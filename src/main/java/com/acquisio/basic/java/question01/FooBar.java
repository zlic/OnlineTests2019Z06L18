/**
 * QUESTION 01: FooBar
 * You have a program that receives a value, which we assume is a positive
 * integer. You need to loop on all integer value between 0 and the value
 * received. Ex.: If you receive 50, you must loop from 0 to 50.
 * <p>
 * The program must follow those rules:
 * - Must print 'Foo' if the value can be divided by 3.
 * - Must print 'Bar' if the value can be divided by 5.
 * - Otherwise, print the current integer value in the loop.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Add all missing javadoc and/or unit tests that you think is necessary.
